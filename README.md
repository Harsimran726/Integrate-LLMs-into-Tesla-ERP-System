# Tesla AI-Integrated ERP System
## Optimizing Operations and Automating Tasks with Advanced LLM and Hybrid Architecture

This project aims to create a fully integrated ERP system for Tesla, leveraging the latest advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically **LLaMA 3.2 8B**, fine-tuned with supervised **LoRA adapters** using an **NVIDIA L4 24GB VRAM GPU**. The system also utilizes **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for dynamic, real-time updates. The hybrid architecture combines the accuracy and precision of fine-tuned LLM responses with the up-to-date information fetched through RAG, optimizing the systemâ€™s ability to provide accurate and actionable insights across all departments in Tesla.
